If you're reading my blog chances are you already know most of this, but my name is Paul Mooring I work at [Opscode](http://www.opscode.com) and I really like all aspects of creating and maintaining web services.  I'm creating this blog to write down my thoughts and opinions on all things tech.  Introductory blog posts are boring so I'm going to stop there and make another post on something more exciting.
